            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p><b>My name is Joseph Mbatchou, and I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce myself to you. <br> <br>

                With eight years of experience in the tech industry, I currently serve as a Teacher Assistant in Cloud Consulting at CloudSpace Consulting, while also holding the position of Part-Time Shift Lead Access Control at Digital Realty / Allied Universal. <br> <br>
                
                My journey began as a Computer Science Teacher and Computer Technician at Biopharcam, a computer sales company in my home country. Upon relocating to the United States, I joined Allied Universal, gradually advancing from an officer to a shift lead position. In this role, I oversaw various applications for training and operational tasks, collaborating closely with engineers and developers from Digital Realty, a data center provider.<br> <br>
                
                Observing these professionals at work sparked my interest in cloud computing, leading me to pursue cloud classes, attend boot camps, and conduct in-depth research across various domains, including training at CloudSpace Academy. This exposure deepened my passion for IT and motivated me to transition into the industry to further my personal growth and contribute to organizational success. <br> <br>
                
                As a Cloud Consultant, I have been privileged to collaborate with Cloud Solution Architects and DevOps teams on numerous projects, consistently exceeding customer expectations through our dedication and innovative solutions. My tenure in this role has enriched my skill set and broadened my professional experience. <br>
                
                Now, equipped with a wealth of knowledge in cloud computing and DevOps practices, I am eager to apply my expertise to new challenges and opportunities. I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your knowledge <br> <br>
                
                Thank you for considering my hard work. I look forward to have you on board of the learning process.</p>
